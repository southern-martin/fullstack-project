# Fullstack Project - Microservices Architecture

## Project Overview
The Fullstack Project is a comprehensive microservices architecture featuring multiple services (auth-service, user-service, seller-service, carrier-service, customer-service) with API Gateway, centralized logging, monitoring, and service discovery. The project follows Clean Architecture principles with consistent patterns across all services.

## Objective
To maintain a scalable, secure, and maintainable microservices architecture with:
- Consistent Clean Architecture patterns across all services
- Centralized API Gateway with Kong integration
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Service discovery with Consul
- Consistent authentication and authorization
- Professional development workflows

## Scope
- **Core Services**: auth-service, user-service, seller-service, carrier-service, customer-service
- **Infrastructure**: API Gateway, Consul, Kong, PostgreSQL, Redis, monitoring stack
- **Development**: Git flow, testing, deployment, documentation
- **Operations**: Monitoring, logging, health checks, security

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Consistent architecture across all microservices
- ✅ Centralized API Gateway with Kong
- ✅ Service discovery with Consul
- ✅ Centralized logging and monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive security and authentication
- ✅ Professional development workflows
- ✅ Automated testing and deployment
- ✅ Performance optimization and scalability

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Service architecture standardization
- **Phase 2**: Infrastructure and gateway setup
- **Phase 3**: Security and authentication implementation
- **Phase 4**: Monitoring and optimization
- **Phase 5**: Testing and deployment automation

## Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: For consistent architecture and maintainability
- **DevOps Team**: For deployment and infrastructure management
- **Security Team**: For authentication and security compliance
- **Product Team**: For feature delivery and user experience
- **Operations Team**: For monitoring and maintenance

## Constraints
