## 🔧 What Was Done

### 1. Customer Service Seed Script Enhancement ✅
- **Scaled from 3 → 400 customers**
- Realistic data generation (names, addresses, companies, industries)
- Progress tracking every 50 customers
- Force-exit mechanism (no hanging)
- Performance: ~2 seconds for 400 customers

### 2. Local Development Script ✅
- **Created `seed-local.sh`**
- Overrides Docker Redis password for local development
- Sets `REDIS_PASSWORD=""` for password-free local Redis
- Eliminates AUTH errors in local environment

### 3. React Admin API Integration Fix ✅
- **Fixed TypeError**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'customers')`
- Root cause: API client returns raw response, not wrapped in `.data`
- Solution: Changed `response.data.customers` → `response.customers`
- Updated 9 customer service methods

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created `CUSTOMER-SERVICE-400-SEED-GIT-FLOW.md` (detailed)
- Created `CUSTOMER-SERVICE-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (quick start)
- Created `CUSTOMER-SERVICE-GIT-FLOW-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` (this file)
