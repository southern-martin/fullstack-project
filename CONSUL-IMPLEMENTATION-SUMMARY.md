# Consul Config Server Implementation Summary

## 📅 Implementation Date
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/consul-config-server`  
**Git Flow**: Feature branch created from `develop`

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement HashiCorp Consul as a centralized configuration management system for the microservices architecture, replacing distributed .env file management with a single source of truth.

---

## ✅ Week 1 Completed Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Added Consul service to `docker-compose.hybrid.yml`
- ✅ Configured Consul server with UI, HTTP API, and DNS
- ✅ Set up health checks for service availability
- ✅ Configured data persistence with Docker volume
- ✅ Tested Consul deployment and verified healthy status

**Container Details:**
```
Container: consul-server
Image: hashicorp/consul:1.17
Ports: 8500 (HTTP/UI), 8600 (DNS)
Status: Running and healthy ✅
```

### 2. Configuration Management
- ✅ Created directory structure: `consul/config/` and `consul/data/`
- ✅ Organized KV store hierarchy by service and shared configs
- ✅ Implemented configuration seeding script with colored output
- ✅ Seeded 54 configuration keys across all services

**Configuration Structure:**
```
config/
├── shared/               # Shared infrastructure (Redis, DB)
├── auth-service/         # JWT, Kong integration
├── user-service/         # Service-specific settings
├── customer-service/     # Database, cross-service URLs

## 🏗️ Architecture Impact

### Before Consul
```
Service 1 → .env file → Config
Service 2 → .env file → Config
Service 3 → .env file → Config
(Distributed, manual synchronization)
```

### After Consul (Week 1)
```
           ┌─────────────────┐
           │  Consul Server  │
           │   (Port 8500)   │
           │                 │
           │   KV Store      │
           │   54 keys       │
           └────────┬────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        │           │           │
    Service 1   Service 2   Service 3
    (Still using .env, ready to migrate)
```

### After Full Migration (Week 2-4)
```
           ┌─────────────────┐
           │  Consul Server  │
           │   (Port 8500)   │
           │                 │
           │   KV Store      │
           │   54 keys       │
           └────────┬────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        ▼           ▼           ▼
    Service 1   Service 2   Service 3
    (Reading from Consul with .env fallback)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Access Consul
```bash
# Open Consul UI
open http://localhost:8500

# Start Consul
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hybrid.yml up -d consul

# Check status
docker ps | grep consul
docker exec consul-server consul members
```

### View Configuration
```bash
# All configs
docker exec consul-server consul kv get -recurse config/

# Translation service config
docker exec consul-server consul kv get config/translation-service/max_batch_translation_size

# Via HTTP API
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/config/translation-service/max_batch_translation_size?raw
```

### Reseed Configuration
```bash
./consul/seed-consul-config.sh
```

---

## 📋 Next Steps - Week 2: Service Integration

### Priority: Translation Service (Pilot Integration)

**Why Translation Service First?**
- Already has externalized config (MAX_BATCH_TRANSLATION_SIZE)
- Good candidate for testing Consul integration
- Less complex than auth or user services

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. ✅ Week 1 Complete: Consul setup and seeding
2. ⏳ Install `consul` npm package
3. ⏳ Create `ConsulConfigModule`
4. ⏳ Create `ConsulConfigService` with fallback logic
5. ⏳ Update `translate-text.use-case.ts` to use ConsulConfigService
6. ⏳ Add environment variables (CONSUL_ENABLED, CONSUL_HOST, CONSUL_PORT)
7. ⏳ Test with Consul enabled/disabled
8. ⏳ Verify config changes require restart (Week 3 adds dynamic reload)

**Code Locations:**
- Module: `src/infrastructure/config/consul-config.module.ts` (create)
- Service: `src/infrastructure/config/consul-config.service.ts` (create)
- Use Case: `src/application/use-cases/translate-text.use-case.ts` (update)
- Docker Compose: Add CONSUL_* env vars to translation-service

### Other Services (Week 2)
After Translation Service pilot is successful:
- Auth Service
- User Service  
- Customer Service
- Carrier Service
- Pricing Service

## 📈 Migration Timeline

| Week | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Setup & Seed Configs | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| Week 2 | Service Integration | ⏳ Not Started |
| Week 3 | Dynamic Config Reload | ⏳ Not Started |
| Week 4 | Documentation & Training | ⏳ Not Started |

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Consul Configuration
```json
{
  "datacenter": "dc1",
  "server": true,
  "bootstrap_expect": 1,
  "ui_config": { "enabled": true },
  "client_addr": "0.0.0.0",
  "ports": {
    "http": 8500,
    "dns": 8600
  }
}
```

### Docker Compose Integration
```yaml
consul:
  image: hashicorp/consul:1.17
  container_name: consul-server
  ports:
    - "8500:8500"  # HTTP API & UI
    - "8600:8600"  # DNS
  volumes:
    - consul_data:/consul/data
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "consul", "members"]
```

### Seeding Statistics
- Total keys: **54**
- Services configured: **7** (6 microservices + shared)
- Script execution time: **~5 seconds**
- Script size: **~210 lines** (with colors and error handling)

---

## 🛡️ Backward Compatibility

### Current Behavior
- ✅ All services continue to use .env files
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing deployments
- ✅ Consul is additive, not replacing configs yet
- ✅ Services work with or without Consul running

### Migration Approach
```typescript
// Week 2: Services read from Consul with .env fallback
const maxBatchSize = await consulConfig.getNumber(
  'MAX_BATCH_TRANSLATION_SIZE',
  process.env.MAX_BATCH_TRANSLATION_SIZE || 200
);

// If Consul unavailable or key missing → uses .env
// If Consul has key → uses Consul value
```

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Set `CONSUL_ENABLED=false` in service env vars
2. Services automatically fall back to .env files
3. No code changes needed
4. Zero downtime rollback

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Setup (Development)
- ⚠️ No ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- ⚠️ No TLS encryption
- ⚠️ Passwords stored in plain text
- ⚠️ Accessible from localhost only

### Production Recommendations
1. **Enable ACLs** for access control
2. **Enable TLS** for encrypted communication
3. **Use Vault** for sensitive data (passwords, secrets)
4. **Multi-server cluster** for high availability
5. **Backup strategy** for KV store
6. **Monitoring** with Prometheus/Grafana

**Note**: Week 4 will include security hardening documentation.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Consul Setup Simplicity
- Consul runs well in Docker with minimal configuration
- UI provides excellent visibility into KV store
- HTTP API is straightforward and well-documented

### 2. Configuration Organization
- Hierarchical KV structure mirrors service architecture
- Shared configs at top level, service-specific below
- Naming convention: `config/{service}/{key}`

### 3. Seeding Script Value
- Automated seeding saves time and prevents errors
- Colored output improves readability
- Health checks prevent seeding to unavailable Consul

### 4. Backward Compatibility Importance
- Gradual migration reduces risk
- Fallback mechanisms ensure service continuity
- Can run mixed environment (Consul + .env)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Tests Performed
- ✅ Consul container starts and becomes healthy
- ✅ UI accessible at http://localhost:8500
- ✅ Seeding script executes without errors
- ✅ All 54 keys visible in Consul UI
- ✅ CLI access to KV store works
- ✅ HTTP API returns correct values
- ✅ Data persists after container restart

### Test Commands Used
```bash
# Health check
docker exec consul-server consul members

# View all configs
docker exec consul-server consul kv get -recurse config/

# Specific value
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/config/translation-service/max_batch_translation_size?raw

# Count keys
curl -s http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/config/?keys | jq '. | length'
```
