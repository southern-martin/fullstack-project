## 🔍 Key Findings

### What's Working Well

1. **API Standardization (100% implemented)**
   - All 6 services use consistent response format
   - Success responses: `{data, message, statusCode, timestamp, success}`
   - Error responses: `{message, statusCode, error, timestamp, path}`
   - TransformInterceptor and HttpExceptionFilter working correctly

2. **Cross-Service Communication**
   - Correlation ID propagation verified
   - Services communicate correctly
   - Winston logging with structured JSON across all services

3. **Database Infrastructure**
   - All databases operational
   - Pricing Service: 7 indexes created for performance
   - Data integrity maintained during migration

4. **Redis Caching**
   - Connection working (PING/PONG successful)
   - Keys being populated
   - TTL expiration working

5. **End-to-End Workflows**
   - Customer lifecycle: ✅
   - Carrier management: ✅
   - Pricing management: ✅
   - Translation integration: ✅
   - Cross-service consistency: ✅
   - Error handling: ✅

### What's Pending (Next Steps)

1. **Migration Rollout to 5 Services**
   - Auth Service (port 3001) - needs migration setup
   - User Service (port 3003) - needs migration setup
   - Customer Service (port 3004) - needs migration setup
   - Carrier Service (port 3005) - needs migration setup
   - Translation Service (port 3007) - needs migration setup

2. **Authentication Enhancement**
   - Some protected endpoints currently allow unauthenticated access
   - JWT validation working but not enforced everywhere
