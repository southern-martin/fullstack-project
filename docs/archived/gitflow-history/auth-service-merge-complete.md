## ‚úÖ Merge Successfully Completed

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Merge Commit**: `2ac0393`  
**Feature Branch**: `feature/auth-service-security-fixes` (now deleted)  
**Target Branch**: `develop`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **MERGED AND PUSHED**

## üéØ What Was Merged

### Critical Security Fixes (P0)

1. **Password Hashing Vulnerability Fixed**
   - Issue: Passwords stored as plain text in database
   - Fix: Added bcrypt hashing in `UserRepository.create()`
   - Impact: All new users get bcrypt-hashed passwords ($2b$10$...)

2. **Password Exposure in API Responses Fixed**
   - Issue: Password field exposed in login/register responses
   - Fix: Removed password from `UserResponseDto` and response mappings
   - Impact: No sensitive data exposure in API responses

### Files Changed

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `user.repository.ts` | Modified | +6 lines (password hashing) |
| `user-response.dto.ts` | Modified | -2 lines (removed password) |
| `login.use-case.ts` | Modified | -1 line (removed password) |
| `register.use-case.ts` | Modified | -1 line (removed password) |
| `CODE-QUALITY-ANALYSIS.md` | New | +484 lines |
| `SECURITY-FIXES-APPLIED.md` | New | +229 lines |

**Total**: 6 files changed, +733 insertions, -56 deletions

## üîí Security Improvements Now in Develop

### Before Merge
```typescript
// ‚ùå VULNERABLE: Plain text passwords
async create(user: User): Promise<User> {
  const entity = this.toTypeOrmEntity(user);
  const savedEntity = await this.repository.save(entity);
  return this.toDomainEntity(savedEntity);
}

// ‚ùå VULNERABLE: Password in response
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "$2b$10$...",  // Exposed!
  }
}
```

### After Merge (Now in Develop) ‚úÖ
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SECURE: Bcrypt hashing
async create(user: User): Promise<User> {
  const entity = this.toTypeOrmEntity(user);
  
  if (user.password) {
    entity.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10);
  }
  
  const savedEntity = await this.repository.save(entity);
  return this.toDomainEntity(savedEntity);
}

// ‚úÖ SECURE: No password in response
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    // No password field!
  }
}
```
