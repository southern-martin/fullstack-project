# Simple Mock Services Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 17, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Simple Mock Service Files
All simple mock Express.js services have been removed to avoid confusion with actual NestJS microservices:

**Files Removed:**
- ✅ `simple-auth-service.js` (root)
- ✅ `simple-translation-service.js` (root)
- ✅ `user-service/simple-user-service.js`
- ✅ `customer-service/simple-customer-service.js`
- ✅ `carrier-service/simple-carrier-service.js`
- ✅ `pricing-service/simple-pricing-service.js`
- ✅ `translation-service/simple-translation-service.js`

### 2. Stopped Running Mock Processes
All running simple service processes were terminated using:
```bash
pkill -f "simple-.*-service.js"
```

## Current Service Status

### ✅ **Running Services**

| Service | Port | Type | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **React Admin** | 3000 | Frontend | ✓ Running |
| **Auth Service** | 3001 | NestJS Microservice | ✓ Running |

### ⚠️ **Not Running (Need Configuration)**

| Service | Port | Type | Issue |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| **User Service** | 3003 | NestJS | Dependency injection errors |
| **Customer Service** | 3004 | NestJS | Not configured |
| **Carrier Service** | 3005 | NestJS | Not configured |
| **Pricing Service** | 3006 | NestJS | Not configured |

## Infrastructure Status

### ✅ **Docker Containers (Running)**
- `shared-mysql` (port 3306) - Shared database for Auth + User services
- `customer-service-db` (port 3309) - Customer service database
- `carrier-service-db` (port 3310) - Carrier service database
- `pricing-service-db` (port 3311) - Pricing service database
- `shared-redis` (port 6379) - Shared Redis cache

## Current Working Configuration

### Auth Service (Port 3001)
```bash
cd auth-service
npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/main.ts
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Full Clean Architecture implementation
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Login/Register/Profile endpoints
- ✅ Connected to shared-mysql database
- ✅ React Admin authentication working

### React Admin (Port 3000)
```bash
cd react-admin
npm start
```

**Features:**
- ✅ TailwindCSS v3 configured
- ✅ Authentication fixed (response structure match)
- ✅ Connected to Auth Service (port 3001)
- ✅ Login working with admin@example.com / admin123

## Next Steps (To Run Other Services)

### Option 1: Fix NestJS Dependency Injection
The User, Customer, Carrier, and Pricing services need proper module configuration:
- Fix dependency injection in `app.module.ts`
- Ensure all repositories are properly provided
- Import shared infrastructure correctly

### Option 2: Use Docker Compose (Recommended for Production)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hybrid.yml up -d
```

Note: This requires fixing Dockerfile issues with @shared/infrastructure package.

## Key Differences: Simple vs Real Services

### Simple Mock Services (Removed)
- Express.js with minimal features
- No database connections
- Health check endpoints only
- Used for testing infrastructure

### Real NestJS Services (Current)
- Full Clean Architecture
- TypeORM database integration
- Complete business logic
- Proper dependency injection
- Production-ready code

## Testing Current Setup

### Test Auth Service
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### Test React Admin
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login with: admin@example.com / admin123
3. Should successfully authenticate

## Important Notes

1. **Only Auth Service is fully operational** - This is the most mature service with complete implementation
2. **Other services need configuration** - User, Customer, Carrier, and Pricing services have code but need module fixes
3. **Infrastructure is ready** - All databases and Redis are running and waiting for services to connect
4. **No more confusion** - Simple mock services are removed, only real microservices remain

## Conclusion

The project now has a clean separation:
- ✅ Production-quality Auth Service (working)
- ✅ React Admin frontend (working)
- ⚠️ Other microservices (code exists, needs configuration)
- ✅ Complete infrastructure (databases + Redis running)

Focus should be on completing the NestJS service configurations to bring User, Customer, Carrier, and Pricing services online.
