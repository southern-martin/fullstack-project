### Test Suite 3: Redis Caching Integration
**Status:** ✅ PASSED (14/14 tests)  
**Success Rate:** 155% (multiple assertions per test)

**Infrastructure Validated:**
- ✅ Redis connection: PING/PONG successful
- ✅ Redis version: 8.2.2 (Uptime: 37+ hours)
- ✅ Basic operations: SET, GET, DEL all working
- ✅ TTL expiration: Cache invalidation working correctly

```

**Performance Observations:**
- First request: 37ms average
- Second request: 37ms average
- Note: Similar response times suggest caching may not be actively reducing latency for test data
- Cache is being populated (keys exist in Redis)

**Sample Test Output:**
```bash
🔍 Redis Connection Test
✅ Redis - Connection successful (PING/PONG)

🔍 Service-Specific Cache Keys
✅ Cache Keys Found:
ℹ️    - Auth Service: 1 keys
ℹ️    - User Service: 1 keys
ℹ️    - Customer Service: 1 keys
ℹ️    - Sessions: 1 keys
