# Kong Health Check Routes - Implementation Summary

**Branch**: `feature/kong-health-check-routes`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Backend Complete | ‚è≥ Kong Routes Pending  
**Date**: October 28, 2025

## Overview

Implemented standardized health check endpoints across all microservices to fix React Admin displaying services as "unhealthy" despite all Docker containers being healthy.

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issue
- **Symptom**: React Admin MicroservicesStatus component showed all services (except Translation) as "unhealthy"
- **Docker Reality**: All 6 services were healthy (verified via `docker ps`)
- **Direct Tests**: All health endpoints returned 200 OK with 2-57ms response times

### Root Cause Discovery
1. Kong Gateway had NO health check routes configured (only Auth service had `/api/v1/auth/health`)
2. React Admin health checks were failing through Kong Gateway (port 8000)
3. Translation service worked because it bypassed Kong (direct access on port 3007)

### Technical Challenge
All services needed `/api/v1/health` endpoints, but:
- Service-specific paths (e.g., `/users/health`) conflicted with `:id` routes
- Unified path (`/api/v1/health`) creates routing ambiguity in Kong
- NestJS parameter validation interpreted "health" as an ID, causing 400 errors

## Implementation

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Backend Health Endpoints (COMPLETE)

Added separate `HealthController` to all services with standardized endpoints:

#### Files Modified:
1. **user-service/src/interfaces/controllers/user.controller.ts** (+19 lines)
   - Added health check endpoint under UserController
   - Later discovered conflict with `:id` routes
   - Separate HealthController already exists at `/api/v1/health`

2. **customer-service/src/interfaces/controllers/customer.controller.ts** (+19 lines)
   - Added health check endpoint  
   - Separate HealthController at `/api/v1/health` works correctly

3. **carrier-service/src/interfaces/controllers/carrier.controller.ts** (+19 lines)
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Separate HealthController at `/api/v1/health` works correctly

4. **pricing-service/src/interfaces/controllers/pricing.controller.ts** (+19 lines)
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Separate HealthController at `/api/v1/health` works correctly

5. **auth-service** - Already had `/api/v1/auth/health` ‚úÖ

#### Health Endpoint Response Format:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-28T03:21:49.776Z",
    "service": "user-service",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "environment": "development"
  },
  "message": "Success",
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

#### Verification:
```bash
# All services restarted successfully
docker restart user-service customer-service carrier-service pricing-service

# All health endpoints working via direct access
curl http://localhost:3003/api/v1/health # User Service ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3004/api/v1/health # Customer Service ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3005/api/v1/health # Carrier Service ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3006/api/v1/health # Pricing Service ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: React Admin API Client Updates (COMPLETE)

Updated all service health check methods to use `/health` endpoint:

#### Files Modified:
1. **react-admin/src/features/users/services/userService.ts**
   - Changed: `/users/health` ‚Üí `/health`
   - Reason: Avoid `:id` route conflicts

2. **react-admin/src/features/customers/services/customerApiClient.ts**
   - Changed: `/customers/health` ‚Üí `/health`

3. **react-admin/src/features/carriers/services/carrierApiClient.ts**
   - Changed: `/carriers/health` ‚Üí `/health`

4. **react-admin/src/features/pricing/services/pricingApiClient.ts**
   - Changed: `/pricing/health` ‚Üí `/health`

5. **Auth service** - Already using `/auth/health` ‚úÖ

#### API Client Pattern:
```typescript
async healthCheck(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    await apiClient.get('/health'); // Routes to: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Service health check failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Kong Gateway Route Configuration (PENDING)

#### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Added Auth Service health route: `/api/v1/auth/health` ‚Üí auth-service ‚úÖ

#### ‚ùå Attempted (Failed):
Created service-specific health routes but they conflict with `:id` routes:
```bash
# These routes were created but don't work due to path conflicts
- /api/v1/users/health ‚Üí user-service (400 validation error)
- /api/v1/customers/health ‚Üí customer-service (400 validation error)  
- /api/v1/carriers/health ‚Üí carrier-service (400 validation error)
- /api/v1/pricing/health ‚Üí pricing-service (404 not found)
- /api/v1/translation/health ‚Üí translation-service (404 not found)
```

#### üîÑ Solution Options:

**Option 1: Host-Based Routing** (Recommended)
Configure Kong routes with different hostnames:

```bash
# User Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/user-service/routes \
  --data 'name=user-health-route' \
  --data 'paths[]=/api/v1/health' \
  --data 'hosts[]=user-service.local' \
  --data 'methods[]=GET'
```

React Admin would send `Host` header:
```typescript
await apiClient.get('/health', {
  headers: { 'Host': 'user-service.local' }
});
```

**Option 2: Request Header Routing**
Use custom headers to route to correct service:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/user-service/routes \
  --data 'name=user-health-route' \
  --data 'paths[]=/api/v1/health' \
  --data 'headers.X-Service=user-service'
```

**Option 3: Unified Health Aggregator Service**
Create a dedicated health check aggregation service:
- Endpoint: `/api/v1/system/health`
- Returns: Status of all microservices
- Simplifies React Admin implementation

**Option 4: Remove Service-Specific Paths from Controllers**
Keep only the separate `HealthController` and remove the conflicting endpoints from business controllers (already partially done).

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Documentation (COMPLETE)

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **api-gateway/KONG-HEALTH-ROUTES-SETUP.md** (345 lines)
   - Problem statement and root cause analysis
   - Solution implementation details
   - Health endpoint specifications
   - Testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Next steps with solution options

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- All 6 microservices have functional `/api/v1/health` endpoints
- All health endpoints return 200 OK via direct access
- Auth Service health check works through Kong Gateway
- React Admin health check code updated to use correct paths
- All services restarted and healthy

### ‚ùå Not Working:
- User, Customer, Carrier, Pricing, Translation health checks through Kong
- React Admin still shows 5 services as "unhealthy" (Auth shows healthy)
- Kong routes for `/api/v1/health` cause routing ambiguity

### üîß Blockers:
1. Kong Gateway needs route configuration that avoids path conflicts
2. Decision needed on which routing solution to implement
3. Potential React Admin changes needed (depending on solution chosen)

## Testing Results

### Direct Service Access (Bypassing Kong):
```bash
# All services return 200 OK ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/health     # Auth: status=ok ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3003/api/v1/health          # User: status=ok ‚úÖ  
curl http://localhost:3004/api/v1/health          # Customer: status=ok ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3005/api/v1/health          # Carrier: status=ok ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3006/api/v1/health          # Pricing: status=ok ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:3007/api/v1/health          # Translation: status=ok ‚úÖ
```

### Through Kong Gateway:
```bash
# Auth works ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/health     # 200 OK ‚úÖ

# Others fail ‚ùå
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health          # No route matched ‚ùå
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/health    # 400 validation error ‚ùå
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/customers/health # 400 validation error ‚ùå
```

### React Admin (Expected):
- **Current**: 1/6 services healthy (Auth only)
- **After Fix**: 6/6 services healthy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Choose routing solution** (recommend Option 1: Host-Based Routing)
2. **Implement Kong routes** for 5 remaining services
3. **Update React Admin** if needed (depends on solution)
4. **Test full integration** via React Admin dashboard
5. **Clean up experimental Kong routes** created during investigation

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] All services return 200 OK through Kong Gateway
- [ ] React Admin dashboard shows 6/6 services healthy
- [ ] Health checks work in all languages (FR/ES)
- [ ] Service restart doesn't break health checks
- [ ] Kong Gateway restart preserves health routes

### Merge Checklist:
- [ ] Kong routes fully configured and tested
- [ ] All services showing healthy in React Admin
- [ ] Documentation updated with final solution
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Merge to `develop` branch

## Related Work

### Completed (Other Branches):
- `feature/consul-config-server` - Consul Week 1 implementation (ready for merge)
- `develop` - Kong CORS fixes, translation batch limits

### Pending:
- Consul Week 2: Service integration with Consul KV store
- Complete microservices health monitoring implementation

## Commands Reference

### Check Service Health:
```bash
# Docker container status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Direct health check
curl http://localhost:300X/api/v1/health

# Through Kong
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

### Kong Route Management:
```bash
# List all routes
curl http://localhost:8001/routes | jq '.data[] | {name, paths}'

# Check health routes
curl http://localhost:8001/routes | jq '.data[] | select(.paths[] | contains("health"))'

# Delete route
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8001/routes/{route-name}
```

### Service Restart:
```bash
# Individual services
docker restart user-service customer-service carrier-service pricing-service

# Full stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hybrid.yml restart
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Route Conflicts**: NestJS `:id` parameter routes can conflict with literal paths like `/health`
2. **Kong Routing**: Unified paths across multiple services require careful route configuration
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Health checks should use separate controllers to avoid business logic conflicts
4. **Testing Strategy**: Always test direct service access first, then through API gateway
5. **Documentation**: Complex routing issues benefit from comprehensive documentation upfront
