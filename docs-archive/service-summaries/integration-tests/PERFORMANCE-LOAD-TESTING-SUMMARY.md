## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Test Script Architecture

```bash
# Script: performance-load-test.sh
# Location: integration-tests/
# Lines of Code: ~710 lines
# Language: Bash with Python for millisecond timing
```

**Key Features:**
- Millisecond-precision timing using Python
- Percentile calculations (P50, P95, P99)
- Parallel request execution for concurrency testing
- Statistical analysis (min, max, avg)
- Color-coded output for readability
- Comprehensive metrics storage

### Testing Methodology

#### Timing Precision
```bash
# Millisecond timestamp function
get_timestamp_ms() {
    python3 -c 'import time; print(int(time.time() * 1000))'
}
```

#### Percentile Calculation
```bash
calculate_percentile() {
    local percentile=$1
    shift
    local values=("$@")
    local sorted=($(printf '%s\n' "${values[@]}" | sort -n))
    local count=${#sorted[@]}
    local index=$(( (count * percentile) / 100 ))
    echo "${sorted[$index]}"
}
```

#### Concurrent Execution
- Uses background processes with `&`
- Limits concurrent connections to prevent overwhelming system
- Collects results from temporary files
- Waits for all background jobs to complete

3. **High Traffic (50-100 req/s):** Load balancing + 3-5 replicas
4. **Very High Traffic (> 100 req/s):** Kubernetes auto-scaling recommended

### Bottleneck Analysis

**No Critical Bottlenecks Identified:**
- âœ… Database: Responding quickly (< 50ms)
- âœ… Redis: Cache performing well (13% improvement)
