---

## 📊 Implementation Details

### 1. Health Check Endpoints

Each service now has a comprehensive health check endpoint that monitors:

- **Database connectivity** - Validates database connection with `SELECT 1` query
- **Redis availability** - Tests cache operations with TTL
- **Consul connectivity** - Verifies Consul API accessibility

**Health Check URLs:**
- User Service: `http://user-service:3003/api/v1/health`
- Customer Service: `http://customer-service:3004/api/v1/health`
- Carrier Service: `http://carrier-service:3005/api/v1/health`
- Pricing Service: `http://pricing-service:3006/api/v1/health`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T04:47:11.655Z",
  "service": "customer-service",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "ok" },
    "redis": { "status": "ok" },
    "consul": { "status": "ok" }
  },
  "uptime": 47216.789,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Consul Service Registration

#### Service Definition Files

Created 4 JSON service definition files in `consul/services/`:

- `user-service.json`
- `customer-service.json`
- `carrier-service.json`
- `pricing-service.json`

**Key Configuration Parameters:**
- **Health Check Interval:** 10 seconds
- **Health Check Timeout:** 5 seconds
- **Success Before Passing:** 2 consecutive successes
- **Failures Before Critical:** 3 consecutive failures
- **Deregister Critical Service After:** 30 seconds

**Service Tags:**
- `microservice` - Service type
- `nestjs` - Framework identifier
- `authentication|customer-management|carrier-management|pricing-management` - Service domain
- `business-logic` - Service category
- `v1` - API version

**Service Metadata:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "framework": "NestJS",
  "database": "MySQL|PostgreSQL"
}
```

### 3. Registration Scripts

#### `register-services.sh`
- Validates Consul connectivity
- Registers all services from JSON definitions
- Verifies registration in Consul catalog
- Provides detailed registration summary

**Usage:**
```bash
cd consul
./register-services.sh
```

#### `check-service-health.sh`
- Queries Consul for all registered services
- Displays detailed health check status
- Shows individual check results (Database, Redis, Consul)
- Provides summary statistics

**Usage:**
```bash
cd consul
./check-service-health.sh
```

#### `test-service-discovery.sh` *(NEW)*
- Demonstrates service discovery via Consul API
- Tests connectivity to discovered services
- Shows DNS-based discovery examples
- Filters services by health status

**Usage:**
```bash
cd consul
./test-service-discovery.sh
```

## 🧪 Test Results

### Registration Test
```
✓ Services registered: 4
  • carrier-service (carrier-service) - carrier-service:3005
  • customer-service (customer-service) - customer-service:3004
  • pricing-service (pricing-service) - pricing-service:3006
  • user-service (user-service) - user-service:3003
```

### Health Check Results
```
✓ Healthy services:  5 (including consul itself)
⚠ Warning services:  0
✗ Critical services: 0

Service Status:
  ✓ carrier-service   - HEALTHY (database: ok, redis: ok, consul: ok)
  ✓ customer-service  - HEALTHY (database: ok, redis: ok, consul: ok)
  ✓ pricing-service   - HEALTHY (database: ok, redis: ok, consul: ok)
  ✓ user-service      - HEALTHY (database: ok, redis: ok, consul: ok)
```

### Service Discovery Test
```
✓ Found services: carrier-service consul customer-service pricing-service user-service

Healthy Instances:
  • user-service:      1 healthy instance(s)
  • customer-service:  1 healthy instance(s)
  • carrier-service:   1 healthy instance(s)
  • pricing-service:   1 healthy instance(s)
```

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: JSON Format for Consul API
**Problem:** Service registration failing with "unknown field" errors  
**Root Cause:** Consul API requires uppercase field names (ID, Name, Tags) not lowercase  
**Solution:** Updated all service JSON files to use proper Consul API format  
**Files Modified:** All 4 service definition files

### Issue 2: Incorrect Health Endpoint Paths
**Problem:** Services showing as critical due to 404 errors  
**Root Cause:** Health endpoints configured as `/health` but actual path is `/api/v1/health`  
**Solution:** Updated service definitions with correct health check URLs  
**Impact:** All services now passing health checks

### Issue 3: Script Parsing Error
**Problem:** Registration script failing to parse service ID  
**Root Cause:** Script expected `['service']['id']` structure after JSON format change  
**Solution:** Updated to read `['ID']` directly from service definition  
**File Modified:** `consul/register-services.sh`

## 🌐 Consul UI Access

**URL:** http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services

**Available Views:**
- **Services List** - Shows all registered services with health status
- **Service Details** - Individual service information with metadata
- **Health Checks** - Detailed health check results and history
- **Nodes** - Consul server and agent information

---

## 🚀 Service Discovery Usage

### API-Based Discovery

**Discover all services:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/services
```

**Get service instances:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/service/user-service
```

**Get only healthy instances:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/health/service/user-service?passing=true
```

### DNS-Based Discovery

**From containers on the same network:**
```bash
# Resolve service address
dig @localhost -p 8600 user-service.service.consul

# Use in application code
http://user-service.service.consul:3003/api/v1/health
```

### Application Integration Example

```typescript
// In microservice code
async function discoverService(serviceName: string) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `http://consul-server:8500/v1/health/service/${serviceName}?passing=true`
  );
  const instances = await response.json();
  
  if (instances.length > 0) {
    const service = instances[0].Service;
    return `http://${service.Address}:${service.Port}`;
  }
  
  throw new Error(`No healthy instances of ${serviceName} found`);
}

// Usage
const userServiceUrl = await discoverService('user-service');
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
1. ✅ **Service Mesh Integration** - Configure Consul Connect for service-to-service encryption
2. ✅ **Load Balancing** - Implement client-side load balancing for service discovery
3. ✅ **Failure Testing** - Simulate service failures to verify deregistration
4. ✅ **Monitoring Integration** - Connect Consul health checks to Prometheus/Grafana

### Future Enhancements
- **Auto-scaling Integration** - Link health status with container orchestration
- **Multi-datacenter Setup** - Expand Consul to multiple datacenters
- **KV Store Usage** - Utilize Consul's key-value store for dynamic configuration
- **Service Intentions** - Define service-to-service authorization policies

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Consul API Format** - Service registration requires uppercase field names (ID, Name, Tags, Check)
2. **Health Check Tuning** - `SuccessBeforePassing` prevents flapping services from being marked healthy too quickly
3. **Network Isolation** - Services must be on the same Docker network as Consul for health checks to work
4. **Endpoint Consistency** - Health endpoints should follow a consistent pattern across all services
5. **Graceful Degradation** - `DeregisterCriticalServiceAfter` allows time for service recovery before deregistration
