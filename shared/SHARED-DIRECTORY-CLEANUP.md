## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Cleanup
```
shared/
├── cross-service-communication.ts    # 532 lines - DEPRECATED
└── infrastructure/                    # Active package
```

### After Cleanup
```
shared/
└── infrastructure/                    # Active package only
```

**Result:** 
- ✅ Cleaner directory structure
- ✅ No deprecated code confusion
- ✅ All services still functional
- ✅ 532 lines of dead code removed

---

## 🎉 Summary

- **Deleted:** 1 deprecated file (532 lines)
- **Breaking Changes:** None (0)
- **Services Affected:** None (0)
- **Time Taken:** < 1 minute
- **Status:** ✅ Success

The `shared` directory is now clean and only contains the active `@shared/infrastructure` package that all services depend on.

## 📝 Next Steps

The shared infrastructure package should be:
1. ✅ Kept and maintained (it's essential)
2. ✅ Used for all common utilities going forward
3. ✅ Updated as needed for new shared functionality
4. ✅ Documented when new exports are added

**No further cleanup needed in the shared directory!** 🎊
