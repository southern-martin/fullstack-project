- [x] Translation Service - Complete Reversion to Old PHP System
  - ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All files updated to old PHP system: Entities (4), Repositories (4), DTOs (7), Domain Service (1), Use Cases (3), Controller (1), Seed Scripts (1). Total: 21/21 files (100%).
- [x] Translation Service - API Testing Setup
  - ‚úÖ Postman collection updated with 14 endpoints, flags added to seed data (30 languages), service compiled successfully. Docker issue with module resolution - use local development for testing.
- [x] API Standards Review - Format Standardization
  - ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Comprehensive review of all microservices API formats completed. Created 4 detailed documentation files:
    - `/docs/API-STANDARDS.md` - Complete standards guide with implementation
    - `/docs/API-STANDARDS-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference cheat sheet
    - `/docs/API-FORMAT-COMPARISON.md` - Current vs Recommended comparison
    - `/docs/API-STANDARDS-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary with migration plan
  - üîç FINDING: All 6 services have inconsistent API response formats
  - ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION: Standardize using shared infrastructure DTOs (ApiResponseDto, ErrorResponseDto)
  - ‚è≥ DECISION REQUIRED: Choose migration approach (2-week standardization recommended)
- [ ] API Standards Implementation - Format Standardization (PENDING APPROVAL)
  - Create global exception filter template
  - Create global transform interceptor template
  - Implement POC in Translation Service
