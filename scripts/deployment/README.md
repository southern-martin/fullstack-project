## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance tests passed
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Backup completed

### During Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging first
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Check service health
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Test critical user flows

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check error rates
- [ ] Verify all services running
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up alerts

## 🔄 Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy new version to green environment
2. Run health checks
3. Switch traffic to green
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep blue as rollback option

### Rolling Deployment
1. Deploy to subset of instances
2. Monitor health
3. Gradually roll out to all instances
4. Monitor performance
5. Rollback if issues detected

### Canary Deployment
1. Deploy to small percentage of users
2. Monitor metrics
3. Gradually increase traffic
4. Full deployment if successful
5. Rollback if issues found

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/fullstack-app

# Check rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/fullstack-app
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
./scripts/deployment/restore-database.sh --backup=backup-2024-01-15.sql

# Run previous migrations
./scripts/deployment/migrate-database.sh --version=previous
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Application Metrics
- Response time
- Error rate
- Throughput
- Memory usage
- CPU usage

### Database Metrics
- Connection count
- Query performance
- Lock wait time
- Disk usage
- Replication lag

### Infrastructure Metrics
- Server health
- Network latency
- Disk I/O
- Load average
- Service availability

## 🔒 Security

### SSL/TLS Configuration
```nginx
# nginx.conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
}
```
