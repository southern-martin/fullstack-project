# 🌿 Enhanced Git Flow for Development

This enhanced Git Flow implementation preserves feature history and maintains clear feature graph lines for better development workflow.

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### ✅ **Feature History Preservation**
- **No-FF Merges:** All feature merges use `--no-ff` to preserve feature history
- **Clear Graph Lines:** Feature branches remain visible in git graph
- **Merge Commits:** Descriptive merge commits with feature information
- **Branch Preservation:** Feature branches are kept for visibility

### ✅ **Advanced Workflow Management**
- **Rebase Support:** Keep features up-to-date with develop
- **Sync Commands:** Sync features with remote repositories
- **Cleanup Tools:** Automated cleanup of merged branches
- **Graph Visualization:** Visual representation of branch structure

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 1. **Initialize Enhanced Git Flow**
```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/gitflow/enhanced-gitflow.sh

# Check current status
./scripts/gitflow/enhanced-gitflow.sh status
```

### 2. **Start a New Feature**
```bash
# Start a feature with proper naming
./scripts/gitflow/enhanced-gitflow.sh start-feature F00001-user-authentication

# Work on your feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication logic"
git commit -m "feat: add password validation"
git commit -m "test: add authentication tests"
```

### 3. **Finish a Feature (Preserves History)**
```bash
# Finish feature with preserved history
./scripts/gitflow/enhanced-gitflow.sh finish-feature F00001-user-authentication

# View the preserved feature history
git log --graph --oneline
```

## 📋 **Complete Workflow Commands**

- ✅ Merge back to develop after release

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### 1. **Rebase Conflicts**
```bash
# If rebase fails
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                     # Stage resolved files
git rebase --continue         # Continue rebase
```

#### 2. **Feature Branch Out of Date**
```bash
# Sync feature with latest develop
./scripts/gitflow/enhanced-gitflow.sh sync-feature F00001-user-auth
```

#### 3. **Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# If merge fails
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                     # Stage resolved files
git commit                    # Complete the merge
```

#### 4. **Force Push Issues**
```bash
# Use force-with-lease for safety
git push origin feature/F00001-user-auth --force-with-lease
```
